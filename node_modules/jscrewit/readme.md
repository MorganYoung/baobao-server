# JScrewIt

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/jscrewit.png?compact=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/jscrewit/)

Use **JScrewIt** to convert your JavaScript code into
[JSFuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSFuck).
JSFuck is an encoding technique that uses only the six characters `!` `(` `)` `+` `[` `]` to produce
syntactically correct JavaScript that can still run in a browser or another JavaScript engine
without any additional software.

Play now with [**jscrew.it**](http://jscrew.it), or give a look at
[jQuery *Screwed*](https://github.com/fasttime/jquery-screwed) for a true example: a working version
of jQuery consisting of only six different characters.

JScrewIt was born as a fork of [aemkei's JSFuck](https://github.com/aemkei/jsfuck) and has
developed into one of the most powerful JSFuck encoders on the web, including a number of unique
features.
* Options to optimize code for a particular set of JavaScript engines or even just for your browser:
  the more specific your engine choice, the shorter the code you'll get.
* Support for all modern JavaScript engines (and a few older ones, too).
* Neatly optimized large file encoding.
* Encode-as-you-type browser interface.

### Example

The following source will do an `alert(1)` in any browser, including Internet Explorer:

```js

## Setup Instructions

### In the Browser

To use JScrewIt in your project, download
[jscrewit.js](https://github.com/fasttime/JScrewIt/blob/master/lib/jscrewit.js) or
[jscrewit.min.js](https://github.com/fasttime/JScrewIt/blob/master/lib/jscrewit.min.js) from GitHub
and include it in your HTML file.

```html
<script src="jscrewit.js"></script>
```

Alternatively, you can hotlink the online file.

```html
<script src="https://rawgithub.com/fasttime/JScrewIt/master/lib/jscrewit.min.js"></script>
```

### In Node.js

If you are using Node.js, you can install JScrewIt with [npm](https://www.npmjs.org).

```
npm install jscrewit
```

Then you can include it in your code.

```js
var JScrewIt = require("jscrewit");
```

## Usage

### Basics

This will encode the `alert(1)` example shown above and run it using `eval`.

```js
var output = JScrewIt.encode("alert(1)");
eval(output);
```

To encode just a plain string rather than an executable script, enclose the text in double or simple
quotes, like when introducing a string literal in JavaScript code.

```js
var output = JScrewIt.encode("'Hello, world!'");
var input = eval(output); // input contains the string "Hello, world!".
```

You can also use escape sequences to encode newlines and other characters.
Note that the initial backslash in an escape sequence must be escaped with another backslash when
writing a "sting in a string".


```js
var output = JScrewIt.encode("\"1.\\n2.\\n\\u263A\"");
/*
1.
2.
â˜º
*/
```

`JScrewIt.encode` also accepts an optional second parameter containing options that control various
aspects of the encoding.
These are covered in the relative section in the [API Reference](Reference.md#JScrewIt.encode).

### Features

One peculiarity of JScrewIt is the ability to generate JSFuck code that is customized for a
particular set of JavaScript engines (web browsers or Node.js).
This optimized code is shorter than generic JSFuck code but does not work everywhere.
To make use of this optimization, you have to specify which *features* the decoder engine is
expected to support.

In order to understand how this works, let's consider the JavaScript functions `atob` and `btoa`.
Not all browsers support these functions: without any further information, JScrewIt will assume that
they are unavailable and will not use them to encode the input.
Anyway, if we know in advance that the browsers we plan to target do support `atob` and `btoa`
indeed, we can let JScrewIt create code that uses those functions whenever that makes the output
shorter.

The way to tell JScrewIt to use a particular set of features is by specifying a value for the
`features` option in the second parameter passed to `encode`.

For instance, the generic `alert(1)` example is 1893 chracters long.

```js
var output = JScrewIt.encode("alert(1)"); // output is 1893 characters
```

But if we specify that we are only interested in code that runs in an up to date Firefox browser,
the output length shrinks to about 50%:

```js
var options = { features: "FF31" };
var output = JScrewIt.encode("alert(1)", options); // 960 characters now
```

Here we have used a particular feature: [`FF31`](Features.md#FF31).
This feature produces the shortest possible code that runs in current Firefox browsers.

We can specify more than one feature using an array, e.g.

```js
var input = "document.body.style.background='red'";
var options = { features: ["ATOB", "WINDOW"] };
var output = JScrewIt.encode(input, options);
```

As opposed to the previous example, the features specified here refer to certain abilities that may
be supported by more than one particular class of browsers or JavaScript engines.
Specifically, [`ATOB`](Features.md#ATOB) indicates native support for the functions `atob` and
`btoa`, while [`WINDOW`](Features.md#WINDOW) refers to a particular string representation of the
global object `self`, where available.
The code generated by JScrewIt will run fine in engines that support both of these features.
In engines that don't support both features, the code may not work, and may produce unpredictable
results.
Most typically, it will throw some kind of error at runtime.

It's important to keep in mind that each of the target engines needs to support every feature we
specify.
So if we want our JSFuck code to run on both Internet Explorer and Safari, this won't work.

```js
{ features: ["IE9", "SAFARI70"] }
```

Instead, we have to specify features supported by both browsers.
These can be retrieved with [`JScrewIt.Feature.commonOf`](Reference.md#JScrewIt.Feature.commonOf).

```js
{ features: JScrewIt.Feature.commonOf("IE9", "SAFARI70") }
```

The features turn out to be [`ANY_DOCUMENT`](Features.md#ANY_DOCUMENT),
[`HISTORY`](Features.md#HISTORY), [`INCR_CHAR`](Features.md#INCR_CHAR),
[`NO_V8_SRC`](Features.md#NO_V8_SRC), [`UNDEFINED`](Features.md#UNDEFINED) and
[`WINDOW`](Features.md#WINDOW) (a quick way to see this is entering
`JScrewIt.Feature.commonOf("IE9", "SAFARI70").toString()` in the browser's console).
With this knowledge, we can rewrite the expression as follows.

```js
{ features: ["ANY_DOCUMENT", "HISTORY", "INCR_CHAR", "NO_V8_SRC", "UNDEFINED", "WINDOW"] }
```
